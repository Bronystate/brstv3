Hello, everyone!  Here's the newest round of polls!

If you'd like to submit a suggestion for next month's movie list, you can find that **[HERE][lotto]**. Next month's theme is **"MARITIME"**.  We're looking to head out to the great blue sea with this month's films.  So strap on your pegleg, set your heading for your favorite sea-faring movie, and maybe sing us a sea shanty along the way!  Or, if you don't know any, feel free to sing along to one of our favorites!

♫ Aye aye aye, I love the sea~ ♫
♫ The reason I'm a sailor 'cuz it's the only way to be~ ♫
♫ Oh I love schooners, and I love ships, and I love that boat that tugs~ ♫
♫ I have nautical images on all my sheets and rugs~ ♫

This submission form will be closed for pre-screening and selection on September 6th, so make sure to vote before then, because you'll be voting on your suggestions very soon after it closes!

As for this weekend, we've got two nautical films already lined up!
