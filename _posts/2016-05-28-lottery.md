We've got a night of animated films in store for you this week.

Coming to you straight from Bollywood is **Sita Sings the Blues**. Despite it's name, it's not about someone discovering the magic of jazz music. No! It's actually about the Hindu epic, The Ramayana. Which is apparently ancient Star Wars, or so I'm informed by a fellow mod.

After we've had our horizons broadend by Bollywood, we return back to the warm, comforting bosom of Disney for **Wreck-It Ralph**.

Your pony episodes for the week are **Pinkie Apple Pie**, and **Keep Calm and Flutter On**.

[Lottery for this weekend is right here][lotto]! Brony Movie Night will begin at 7:00 PM EDT Friday and for Euro-reprise at 2:00 EDT Saturday, and we will draw the lottery winners on Saturday, between movies. Don't forget to stick around after movie night for an encore of the new episode as well!


Here's our lineup for this week's movie nights
