Hello all and welcome to the first post under new voting system for movie nights. 
The new system is still a work in progress but we will be taking viewer comments and 
feed back in order to improve how things work.
The results for the first months voting can be found **[HERE][result]**, 
sans the names of the winners cause we like to keep some surprise.

Also, if you'd like to submit a suggestion for next month's movie list, you can do so here. 
Next month's theme is **["MUSICALS!"][poll]** This submission form will be closed for pre-screening and selection on August 12th!
More information about the changes can be found **[HERE.][news]**

Movies will be shown at 7PM EDT on Friday with a Rerun showing for our Euro viewers on Saturday at 2PM EDT.
