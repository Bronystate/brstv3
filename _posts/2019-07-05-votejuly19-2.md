Hello, everyone!  We've looked through your suggestions and we're ready for your votes!

Voting for this month's films is **[HERE][lotto]**!  This month's theme is **"RESISTANCE"**.  We're looking to put up a good fight against The Man, and we're not gonna let him keep us down!  So we're looking for any films which feature a small band of fighters facing off against tyranny, oppression, or maybe just trying to stay alive.  And it doesn't have to be war-related!  Just remember that you can't trust the system.

This poll will be closed on July 12th, so be sure to vote before then!

As for this week (July 5-6), we have the following planned for you:
-	**[V for Vendetta (2005)][m1]**
-	**[Elysium (2013)][m2]**
-	**[MLP FiM 9x01 - The Beginning of the End - Part 1][p1]**
-	**[MLP FiM 9x02 - The Beginning of the End - Part 2][p2]**

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  All of the films for next month will be announced in our next news post.  Hope to see you then!  And don't forget: Season 9 is starting up on April 6th! We will be airing the episode live as we usually do, so be sure to tune in for that!
