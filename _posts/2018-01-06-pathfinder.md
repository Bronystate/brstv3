Hello everyone!

Many of you have attended Bronystate in the past primarily to see our "Movie Nights", and we thank you for your regular attendance!  But what you may not know is that we also do all sorts of other fun streams at various times in the day for your viewing pleasure, ranging from games to television shows to anime, and even sometimes a surprise movie showing or two.  We pride ourselves on having a large variety of quality content to show off to you guys, and today, I'm pleased to share that we have a new offering to add to that list!

Several of our mods have been working behind the scenes to prepare a Pathfinder adventure path, and **starting tomorrow (this Sunday) at 10 AM EST**, we'll be live-streaming Pathfinder for your entertainment!  If you're not familiar with Pathfinder, it's a relatively popular variation of the traditional role-playing game, Dungeons and Dragons.  Our mods will be playing as their own custom-designed characters, with ValtheJean as our Dungeon Master.  It promises to be an awful lot of fun!

We hope to have these segments as often as possible (time permitting) at the same day and time each week, **Sundays at 10 AM EST**.  If you miss a session, don't worry!  We plan to record and catalog every session for upload on Youtube, so you'll never miss out on any of the action.

Hope to see you there!
