Hello, everyone!  Here's the newest round of polls!

If you'd like to submit a suggestion for next month's movie list, you can find that **[HERE][lotto]**. Next month's theme is **"HEISTS"**.  We're looking for films that focus around stealing valuables.  Whether they be gold, jewels, cars, or whatever, a good heist is always a lot of fun.  Sometimes they're action-packed, while others might be more about the mind games, but any type of heist will do!

This submission form will be closed for pre-screening and selection on May 3rd, so make sure to vote before then, because you'll be voting on your suggestions very soon after it closes!

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  All of the films for next month will be announced in our next news post.  Hope to see you then!  And don't forget: Season 9 is starting up on April 6th!  We will be airing the episode live as we usually do, so be sure to tune in for that!
