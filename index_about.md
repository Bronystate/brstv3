# About Us

The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. There isn't a
rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. When things
happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts.

With practice comes confidence. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail
at? Do an almighty painting with us. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk
to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. We
must be quiet, soft and gentle. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put
it one canvas.

Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. Talent is a pursued
interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. Everyone is going to
see things differently - and that's the way it should be. That's what makes life
fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you
want. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it
finished in your mind before you ever start.
