Hello, everyone!  We've looked through your suggestions and we're ready for your votes!

Voting for this month's films is **[HERE][lotto]**!  This month's theme is **"OFF-WORLD ADVENTURES"**.  It's the common fish-out-of-water story: someone ends up on another world (or another dimension), sometimes traveling with unusual companions, and is often totally out of their element.  Maybe they're going on an adventure through this strange land, or maybe they're the chosen one destined to save that world from destruction, or maybe they just want to find their way back home.  We're looking for you to share stories of these strange new worlds with us!

This poll will be closed on August 10th, so be sure to vote before then!

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  All of the films for next month will be announced in our next news post.  Hope to see you then!
