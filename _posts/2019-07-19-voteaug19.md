Hello, everyone!  Here's the newest round of polls!

If you'd like to submit a suggestion for next month's movie list, you can find that **[HERE][lotto]**. Next month's theme is **"BACK TO SCHOOL"**.  It's that time of the year again!  We're looking to get ready for the new year, and that means it's time to bring out the school-related films.  Whether it's about attending school or skipping it, student or teacher, we're eager to get the year started right with some fresh new ideas!

This submission form will be closed for pre-screening and selection on July 26th, so make sure to vote before then, because you'll be voting on your suggestions very soon after it closes!

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  All of the films for next month will be announced in our next news post.  Hope to see you then!  And don't forget: Season 9 has finally begun!  We will be airing new episodes live as we usually do, so be sure to tune in for that!
