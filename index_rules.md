* * * * *

## Ban Appeals

**Know the difference between a kick and a ban**

When you are kicked, your client will print a message stating you were kicked, with a reason (in parentheses).  
When you are banned, the kick message will say so, and you will be unable to join chat until the ban is lifted.

You must appeal a ban in order for it to be lifted.

**WARNING:** Attempting to evade your ban by any means revokes your right to appeal.

Appeals should be sent to **bronystate@gmail.com** with the subject **Ban Appeal**. You must include:

 - Your nick
 - The reason for your ban
 - Approximate date you were banned
 - Reason why we should unban you

Appeals will be **posted publicly** on the site.

Bronystate Staff will evaluate your appeal and make a decision whether or not the ban will be lifted.

You may continue to appeal a ban if your first attempt is rejected.
