## Ban Appeals

You must appeal a ban in order for it to be lifted.

Appeals should be sent to **bronystate@gmail.com** with the subject **Ban Appeal**. You must include:

 - Your nick
 - The reason for your ban
 - Approximate date you were banned
 - Reason why we should unban you

Appeals will be **posted publicly** on the site.  
Bronystate Staff will evaluate your appeal and make a decision whether or not the ban will be lifted.  
You may continue to appeal a ban if your first attempt is rejected.

**WARNING:** Attempting to evade your ban by any means revokes your right to appeal.

## Brony Movie Night and the Lottery

*[Eastern Time]: UTC-5, -4 during US Daylight Saving Time

Movie Nights are held every Friday at 7pm Eastern Time and Saturday at 2pm Eastern Time, and consist of two
movies chosen by our users and two episodes of *My Little Pony* (in sequential order).

Each month, near the end of the month, we send out two forms you can use to help decide the movies to be shown.
The first form allows you to suggest films for the following month according to a specific "theme" chosen by the
Bronystate staff.  The staff looks over these suggestions and uses them to help create the list of possible films for
the following month.  Deadlines for each of these suggestions forms will be clearly listed at the top of the form.
 
The second form is a poll that allows you to vote on which films you'd like to see that month.  Films will often be
chosen from the suggestions given, but are not limited to those alone.  You can choose up to 8 films (ranked from 1st
to 8th), but there are a lot of choices, so choose wisely!  Deadlines for your votes will be clearly listed at the
top of the form.

Films may be disqualified by the following criteria:

 - Movies are eligible for voting **one year** after their theatrical release.
 - Movies earning extraordinarily terrible chat reception may be classified **Worst Movie Clause**, ineligible to air ever again.
 - Movies that do not fit the theme or do not meet the community's standards may be disqualified at staff discretion.
