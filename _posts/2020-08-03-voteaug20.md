Hello, everyone!  Here's the newest round of polls!

If you'd like to submit a suggestion for next month's movie list, you can find that **[HERE][lotto]**. The theme is **"MADE FOR TV"**!  Since we're all still stuck at home, we're looking for some films that were made with the small screen in mind.  Made-for-TV films are very common, and they aren't always the best in terms of production, but there are times when these films can be surprisingly good little gems!  At the very least, it's a good way to kill a few hours.  So send us your favorite made-for-TV films!

This submission form will be closed for pre-screening and selection on August 7th during intermission on Movie Night, so make sure to vote before then, because you'll be voting on your suggestions very soon after it closes!

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  All of the films for next month will be announced in our next news post.  Hope to see you then!
