In preparation for the new season, **all bans were unset** on March 23.

This is both an olive branch for past troublemakers, and a bit of housekeeping
for us. In previous years, we would clear the ban list around New Years, but we
decided to do it in advance of Season 6 instead.

**THIS IS NOT AN INVITATION TO BREAK RULES**
{: .color-warning}

We will not hesitate to reapply a ban to any user that tries to earn it again.
You are welcome to stay so long as you don't act like you've beaten the system.
If you are banned, for the first time or not, consult the [Ban Appeals][ba]
section of the Rules. Note that appeals will be posted publicly, so always be
earnest and honest.

Please take a moment and read the [Rules][r] and [Help][h] pages, as information
may have changed since you last visited us.

We hope you're looking forward to the new season! Thanks for helping keep
Bronystate a safe and friendly place to chat!
