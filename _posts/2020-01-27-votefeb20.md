Hello, everyone!  Here's the newest round of polls!

If you'd like to submit a suggestion for next month's movie list, you can find that **[HERE][lotto]**. Next month's theme is **"JAILBREAK"**.  We've been up to no good again, and it's time to fly the coop before the cops arrive!  Any films involving an attempt to escape from jail would be included in this month's selection, so come up with your best laid plans and send them to us!  And don't worry, we'll make sure you get a cut.

This submission form will be closed for pre-screening and selection on January 31st during intermission on Movie Night, so make sure to vote before then, because you'll be voting on your suggestions very soon after it closes!

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  All of the films for next month will be announced in our next news post.  Hope to see you then!
