Hello, everyone!  Here's the newest round of polls!

If you'd like to submit a suggestion for next month's movie list, you can find that **[HERE][lotto]**. Next month's theme is **"MAGIC"**.  We're not looking for the same old tricks we've seen before.  We want to see some real magic this month!  So get out your magic wand, and conjure up the best magic films you've got, even if you have to pull it from a hat.

This submission form will be closed for pre-screening and selection on February 29th during intermission on Movie Night, so make sure to vote before then, because you'll be voting on your suggestions very soon after it closes!

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  All of the films for next month will be announced in our next news post.  Hope to see you then!
