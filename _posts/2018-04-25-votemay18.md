Hello, everyone!  Here's the newest round of polls!

Voting for this month's films is **[HERE][lotto]**!  This month's theme is **"ANIMALS"**.  This poll will be closed on April 30th, so make sure to vote before then!

Next month will be Mod Picks, so no poll for June!

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  All of the films for next month will be announced in our next news post.  Hope to see you then!
