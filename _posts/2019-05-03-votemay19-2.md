Hello, everyone!  We've looked through your suggestions and we're ready for your votes!

Voting for this month's films is **[HERE][lotto]**!  This month's theme is **"HEISTS"**!  We're looking for films that focus around stealing valuables. Whether they be gold, jewels, cars, or whatever, a good heist is always a lot of fun. Sometimes they're action-packed, while others might be more about the mind games, but any type of heist will do!

This poll will be closed on May 10th, so be sure to vote before then!

As for this week (May 3-4), we have the following planned for you:
-	**[Going in Style (2017)][m1]**
-	**[Sneakers (1992)][m2]**
-	**[MLP FiM 8x09 - Non-Compete Clause][p1]**
-	**[MLP FiM 8x10 - The Break Up Breakdown][p2]**

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  All of the films for next month will be announced in our next news post.  Hope to see you then!  And don't forget: Season 9 is starting up on April 6th! We will be airing the episode live as we usually do, so be sure to tune in for that!
