We've reached the end of another year!  We thought it might be nice to take a break from voting for a month and do some good old fashioned....mostly new superhero movies from the last year or so.  That's right, it's time for Marvelmas once again!  This year, we will cover all of Phase 3's films.

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  The films and episodes for the month of December are....
