Hello, everyone!  We've looked through your suggestions and we're ready for your votes!

Voting for this month's films is **[HERE][lotto]**!  This month's theme is **"WAR"**. It never changes (except when it does). Any movie involving war, regardless of form, is what we're looking for this week.

This poll will be closed on November 9th, so be sure to vote before then!

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  All of the films for next month will be announced in our next news post.  Hope to see you then!
