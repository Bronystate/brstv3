Hello, everyone!  We've looked through your suggestions and we're ready for your votes!

Voting for this month's films is **[HERE][lotto]**!  This month's theme is **"HERESY"**.  Ever been talking with a friend or co-worker and they admit to not having seen a movie that you thought pretty much everyone in the universe had seen? Those are the films we're looking for. What films are "must-see" films that you can't go your whole life without watching?

This poll will be closed on October 6th, so be sure to vote before then!

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  All of the films for next month will be announced in our next news post.  Hope to see you then!
