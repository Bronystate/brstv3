Hello, everyone!  Here's the newest round of polls!

If you'd like to submit a suggestion for next month's movie list, you can find that **[HERE][lotto]**. Next month's theme is **"WAR"**.  It never changes (except when it does).  Any movie involving war, regardless of form, is what we're looking for this week.

This submission form will be closed for pre-screening and selection on November 4th, so make sure to vote before then, because you'll be voting on your suggestions very soon after it closes!

And don't worry, we have this weekend covered!  Here's what we've chosen to start off this month's theme of "WAR":

November 2-3
-	**[All Quiet on the Western Front (1930)][m1]**
-	**[Joyeux Noel (2005)][m2]**
-	**[MLP FiM 6x11 - Flutter Brutter][p1]**
-	**[MLP FiM 6x12 - Spice Up Your Life][p2]**

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  All of the films for next month will be announced in our next news post.  Hope to see you then!
