# THEATERS HAVE MOVED!

With the launch of Bronystate 3.0, the separate theater pages have been *removed*.

In their place, we now have a [simpler home page](/) containing the stream and 
chat embeds.

**PLEASE UPDATE YOUR BOOKMARKS** to point to [http://www.bronystate.net/](/)

## Hello SPIKE users!

You can still connect your own irc client to **irc.ponychat.net**, and we
suspect you already have. On the front page, click on the chat bubble icon under
the stream to remove the chat embed and make the stream player take up the width
of the page.
