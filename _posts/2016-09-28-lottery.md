This week we're showing the three previous Equestria Girls movies as part of our celebration of the fourth movie's, **Legends of Everfree**, release. The lotto from last week has carried over to this week, so if you already voted last week there is no need to do so for this week. We will be jumping straight into **Legends of Everfree**, once this week's new episode has finished airing. *(This time may change, and this post will update to reflect any changes.)*

[Lottery for this weekend is right here][lotto]! Brony Movie Night will begin at 7:00 PM EDT Friday and for Euro-reprise at 2:00 PM EDT Saturday, and we will draw the lottery winners on Saturday, between movies. There will also be an encore of the new episode after Saturday's showing.
