# THEATERS HAVE MOVED!

With the launch of Bronystate 3.0, the separate theater pages have been *removed*.

In their place, we now have a [simpler home page](/) containing the stream and 
chat embeds.

**PLEASE UPDATE YOUR BOOKMARKS** to point to [http://www.bronystate.net/](/)

## Hello RARITY users!

Click on Rarity's cutie mark on the front page to connect to the 
**#rarity** channel. Please note that you are also connected to
**#bronystate** and that the pony side rooms are muted except during new
episodes.

You can connect your own irc client to **irc.ponychat.net**, and click on the
chat bubble icon under the stream to remove the chat embed and make the stream
player take up the width of the page.
