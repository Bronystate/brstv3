Hello, everyone!  We've looked through your suggestions and we're ready for your votes!

Voting for this month's films is **[HERE][lotto]**!  This month's theme is **"MAGIC"**.  We're not looking for the same old tricks we've seen before.  We want to see some real magic this month!  So get out your magic wand, and conjure up the best magic films you've got, even if you have to pull it from a hat.

This poll will be closed on March 7th, so be sure to vote before then!

As for this week (March 6-7), we have the following planned for you:
-	**[The Sword in the Stone (1963)][m1]**
-	**[Willow (1988)][m2]**
-	**[MLP FiM 2x11 - Hearth's Warming Eve][p1]**
-	**[MLP FiM 2x12 - Family Appreciation Day][p2]**

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  All of the films for next month will be announced in our next news post.  Hope to see you then!
