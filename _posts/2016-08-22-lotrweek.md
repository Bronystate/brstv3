Summer is ending, which means it's time for us to send it off with our traditional bang of **The Lord of the Rings** extended cut weekend. But wait, there's more! This year we can finally run the extended cut of **The Hobbit**! I think that clocks the whole experience in at nearly twenty-four hours of Middle Earth for your eyeholes all week long.

We will still be streaming the new episode at its regularly scheduled time on Saturday, and the lotto will return September 2nd. Below you will find a simplified schedule of this week's events.

 - Monday-Wednesday: **The Hobbit Trilogy Extended Cut** at 7pm EDT
 - Thursday: **No Movies**
 - Friday: **LoTR:Fellowship of the Ring** at 7pm EDT
 - Saturday: **LoTR:The Two Towers** at 2pm EDT
 - Sunday: **LoTR: The Return of the King** at 2pm EDT
