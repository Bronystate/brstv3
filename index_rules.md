## Ban Appeals

**Know the difference between a kick and a ban**

When you are kicked, your client will print a message stating you were kicked, with a reason (in parentheses).  
When you are banned, the kick message will say so, and you will be unable to join chat until the ban is lifted.

You must appeal a ban in order for it to be lifted.

**WARNING:** Attempting to evade your ban by any means revokes your right to appeal.

Appeals should be sent to **bronystate@gmail.com** with the subject **Ban Appeal**. You must include:

 - Your nick
 - The reason for your ban
 - Approximate date you were banned
 - Reason why we should unban you

Appeals will be **posted publicly** on the site.  
Bronystate Staff will evaluate your appeal and make a decision whether or not the ban will be lifted.  
You may continue to appeal a ban if your first attempt is rejected.

## Brony Movie Night and the Lottery

*[Eastern Time]: UTC-5, -4 during US Daylight Saving Time

Movie Nights are held every Friday at 7pm Eastern Time and Saturday at 2pm Eastern Time, and consist of two
movies chosen by our users and two episodes of *My Little Pony* (in sequential order).

Each month, near the end of the month, we send out two forms you can use to help decide the movies to be shown.
The first form is a poll that allows you to vote on which films you'd like to see that month.  You can choose up
to 8 films (ranked from 1st to 8th), but there are a lot of choices, so choose wisely!  You will have one week to
make your selections for this poll, and voting will be closed at the start of Movie Night on Saturday.
 
The second form allows you to suggest films for the following month according to a specific "theme" chosen by the
Bronystate staff.  The staff looks over these suggestions and uses them to help create the list for the following
month's vote.  You will have two weeks to provide your suggestions, and the form will be closed at the start of Movie
Night on Saturday.

Films may be disqualified by the following criteria:

 - Movies are eligible for voting **one year** after their theatrical release
 - Movies must wait **six months** before being eligible for Movie Night again
 - Users must wait **four weeks** before they may win another movie or episode, whichever they won previously
 - Movies shown **three times** are entered into the Bronystate Vault, ineligible for airing except on special occasion
 - Movies earning extraordinarily terrible chat reception may be classified **Worst Movie Clause**, ineligible to air ever again
 - Movies that do not fit the theme or do not meet the community's standards may be disqualified at staff discretion
