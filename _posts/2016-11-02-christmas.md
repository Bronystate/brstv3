 ~Fa la la la la~ ~La la la Loki~
 
 Tis the season to deck the halls, ironically wear ugly sweaters, and reflect on your failures of the past year while you drown your sorrows in eggnog. We'll be ringing out the last days of 2016 with a two week long movie extravaganza!
 
 First up, we're stuffing your stockings this Christmas with all the Marvel movies. Movies will run every night at 7pm EST from Sunday, December 18th straight through to Christmas Eve.
 
 Then come back on Monday, December 26th through New Year's Day for our Mod Pick week. The week where mods choose the movies that will air, to show you all that you have terrible taste.
 
 Let's all come together to bid 2016 a fond farewell, and to let it know not to let the door hit it in the ass on the way out.
