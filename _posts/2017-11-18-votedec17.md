Hello, everyone!  Here's the newest round of polls!

Voting for this month's films is **[HERE][lotto]**!  This month's theme is **"NAUGHTY OR NICE"**.  This poll will be closed on November 25th after the start of Movie Night, so make sure to vote before then!

Also, if you'd like to submit a suggestion for next month's movie list, you can find that **[HERE][lotto2]**.   Next month's theme is **"NEW BEGINNINGS"**!  This submission form will be closed for pre-screening and selection on December 2nd after the start of Movie Night!

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  The first two films for next month will be announced on Saturday during intermission.  As for the rest, we'll provide you with little "clues" to try and figure them out.  But don't worry: if you're not into that sort of thing, we'll continue to update the front page with each week's films, so you'll always know which films are coming next.
