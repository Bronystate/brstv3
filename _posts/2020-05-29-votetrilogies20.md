Hello, everyone!  Here's the newest round of polls!

If you'd like to submit a suggestion for next month's movie list, you can find that **[HERE][lotto]**. The theme is **"TRILOGIES"**!  We thought we'd try something a bit different this time around and let you all suggest which trilogies you'd like to see!  And unlike with previous submissions, you're free to resubmit this form as many times as you like to suggest as many trilogies as you'd like!  We'll shift through the whole pile and pluck out the films you guys want to see most!

This submission form will be closed for pre-screening and selection on May 31st during intermission on Movie Night, so make sure to vote before then, because you'll be voting on your suggestions very soon after it closes!

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  All of the films for next month will be announced in our next news post.  Hope to see you then!
