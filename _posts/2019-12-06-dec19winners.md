Hello there folks. Like every year around this time, we dedicate either the month of December or January to one studio. With one particular story line coming to a close this year, we thought it a good idea to go with a solid Marvelmass.
And before you ask how many movies we had to prune to fit December: We will use both months. That way we can go through all relevant movies in one fell swoop.

Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT (1:00 AM CET) on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT (20:00 CET) on Saturday.  The films and episodes these 2 months are:
