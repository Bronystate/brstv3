Hello, everyone! We've looked through your suggestions and we're ready for your votes!

Voting for this month's films is **[HERE][lotto]**!  This month's theme is **"RAGTAG GROUP"**.  We're putting together a team. A team composed of misfits, outcasts, losers, or otherwise dreadfully downcast people to send off on a grand adventure! As they work together in the most dire of circumstances, they might learn more about themselves and grow together. Or maybe they don't. Sometimes it's just nice to have some friends to be with.

This poll will be closed on February 17th, so be sure to vote before then!

As for this weekend, we've got two films already lined up!

| Date | First Movie | Second Movie | 1st Pony Episode | 2nd Pony Episode |
| :----------: | :---------------: | :---------------: | :---------------: | :---------------: | 
| Feb 12-13 | [Ghostbusters (1984)][m1] | [The Muppet Movie (1979)][m2] | [MLP FiM 7x01 - Celestial Advice][p1] | [MLP FiM 7x02 - All Bottled Up][p2] |

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  All of the films for next month will be announced in our next news post.  Hope to see you then!
