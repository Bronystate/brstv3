So strap on your pegleg, set your heading for your favorite sea-faring movie, and maybe sing us a sea shanty along the way!  Or, if you don't know any, feel free to sing along to one of our favorites!

♫ Aye aye aye, I love the sea~ ♫
♫ The reason I'm a sailor 'cuz it's the only way to be~ ♫
♫ Oh I love schooners, and I love ships, and I love that boat that tugs~ ♫
♫ I have nautical images on all my sheets and rugs~ ♫
