Hello, everyone! We've looked through your suggestions and we're ready for your votes!

Voting for this month's films is **[HERE][lotto]**!  This month's theme is **"MARITIME"**.  We're looking to head out to the great blue sea with this month's films.  So strap on your pegleg, set your heading for your favorite sea-faring movie, and maybe sing us a sea shanty along the way!  Or, if you don't know any, feel free to sing along to one of our favorites!

♫ Aye aye aye, I love the sea~ ♫
♫ The reason I'm a sailor 'cuz it's the only way to be~ ♫
♫ Oh I love schooners, and I love ships, and I love that boat that tugs~ ♫
♫ I have nautical images on all my sheets and rugs~ ♫

This poll will be closed on September 15th, so be sure to vote before then!

As for this weekend, we've got two nautical films already lined up!
