Hello, everyone!  Here's the newest round of polls!

If you'd like to submit a suggestion for next month's movie list, you can find that **[HERE][lotto]**. Next month's theme is **"RELUCTANCE"**.  After such a tough year, it's understandable if you don't want to get up and do much.  That's why this month, we're going to watch some films featuring protagonists who are content with their lives, and aren't looking for big life changes.  But sometimes, life comes at you fast, and you're forced to rise to the occasion!  Or maybe it doesn't, and you'd prefer to watch everyday people stay ordinary.  It's up to you!

This submission form will be closed for pre-screening and selection on January 5th, so make sure to vote before then, because you'll be voting on your suggestions very soon after it closes!

To help you get an idea of what we're looking for, we've got two films already selected for this week!

| Date | First Movie | Second Movie | 1st Pony Episode | 2nd Pony Episode |
| :----------: | :---------------: | :---------------: | :---------------: | :---------------: |

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  Hope to see you then!
