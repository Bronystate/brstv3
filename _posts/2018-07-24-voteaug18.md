Hello, everyone!  Here's the newest round of polls!

If you'd like to submit a suggestion for next month's movie list, you can find that **[HERE][lotto]**. Next month's theme is **"OFF-WORLD ADVENTURES"**.  It's the common fish-out-of-water story: someone ends up on another world (or another dimension), sometimes traveling with unusual companions, and is often totally out of their element.  Maybe they're going on an adventure through this strange land, or maybe they're the chosen one destined to save that world from destruction, or maybe they just want to find their way back home.  We're looking for you to share stories of these strange new worlds with us!

This submission form will be closed for pre-screening and selection on July 27th, so make sure to vote before then, because you'll be voting on your suggestions very soon after it closes!

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  All of the films for next month will be announced in our next news post.  Hope to see you then!
