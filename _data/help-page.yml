- i: howto-lottery
  q: Where do I go to vote for Movie Night?
  a: |
    Each month we will put out a news post that provides you with two links.  The first link
    allows you to vote on a list of films that may be shown for that month.  The second
    link allows you to submit suggestions for the following month's vote, according to the
    "theme" for that month.
    
    Note that only the most recent post will have a valid link.  You cannot vote in an
    expired poll!
    
- i: backlog
  q: What movies have been shown at Bronystate?
  a: |
    We maintain a backlog of every movie we've ever shown under the new theme system.  It
    can be found at: <https://bit.ly/2OB1EH6>
     
    The backlog for all movies shown prior to the introduction of the theme system can be
    found at: <http://bit.ly/bronystatebacklog>
    
- i: howto-Discord
  q: What happened to the chat?
  a: |
    As of November 2018, we have swapped over to Discord in place of our usual Ponychat embed.
    We have provided an embedded web client for Discord on the site itself, or you can download
    the Discord client and use this invite link to gain access to our server:
    <https://discord.gg/cGFMYaa>

- i: novideo
  q: Why is chat talking about a stream if it looks offline to me?
  a: |
    We have probably just swapped stream embeds, which can take up to an hour to
    filter through our caching. Try visiting <http://www.bronystate.net/index.html>
    directly, and flush your browser cache. This will bring you the most current
    version of the front page, and you should see the stream again.

- i: adblocking
  q: Why are there ads on the stream?
  a: |
    Use an ad-blocking extension for your browser to prevent stream ads from
    running. We recommend [uBlock Origin][uo] for its active maintenance, low
    CPU and memory footprint, and effectiveness across all platforms.
    
    Live airings of new *Friendship is Magic* episodes are captured directly
    from a cable connection, so commercials are unavoidable. Bronystate re-airs
    the new episode without commercials following our Saturday Movie Night
    event.

- i: nopones
  q: Why aren't there ponies on the stream?
  a: |
    We don't always show *My Little Pony*, because too much of a good thing is,
    well, too much of a good thing. We like to keep things varied at Bronystate,
    and so show programming of all kinds. Today maybe it's gaming, tomorrow an
    old show you didn't realize you missed, the next day maybe everyone's busy
    and there's no stream at all.
    
    The only fixed events we hold are the Friday and Saturday Movie Nights, and
    live new episodes of *My Little Pony* as they air.
    
    Stay tuned to Bronystate, you never know what will come up next!

- i: issue-reporting
  q: How do I report an issue with the site or make a suggestion?
  a: |
    We maintain a public issue tracker at [our Github repository][gh]. If you
    see a bug somewhere on the site, or have a suggestion, please open an issue,
    and we will get back to you. Please note that you will require a Github
    account in order to open issues.
    
    If you have a suggestion for an improvement to the site, and are comfortable
    with code, try forking the repository and making the changes yourself in a
    new branch, and pull request that branch back to us! We'd love to have your
    input on new features.

  q: How do I appeal a ban?
