Hello, everyone!  Here's the newest round of polls!

If you'd like to submit a suggestion for next month's movie list, you can find that **[HERE][lotto]**. Next month's theme is **"HAPPY"**.  We're looking for any film which makes you smile, smile, smile, yes we are!  In times like these, it can sometimes be really helpful to curl up with a good positive movie that helps you get away from things.  So we want to see your ideas for what sort of films make you happy!  And yes, we're aware that's a fairly broad category, so have some fun with it!

This submission form will be closed for pre-screening and selection on March 28th during intermission on Movie Night, so make sure to vote before then, because you'll be voting on your suggestions very soon after it closes!

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  All of the films for next month will be announced in our next news post.  Hope to see you then!
