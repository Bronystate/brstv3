Hello, everyone!  Here's the newest round of polls!

If you'd like to submit a suggestion for next month's movie list, you can find that **[HERE][lotto]**. Next month's theme is **"THE GOOD OLD DAYS"**.  Let's keep the happy feelings going for another month!  This time, we're looking for any film which brings back those classic feelings of joy from your past.  Let the nostalgia flow out and show us how you remember the good old days!

This submission form will be closed for pre-screening and selection on April 30th during intermission on Movie Night, so make sure to vote before then, because you'll be voting on your suggestions very soon after it closes!

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  All of the films for next month will be announced in our next news post.  Hope to see you then!
