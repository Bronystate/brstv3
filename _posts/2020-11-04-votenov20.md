Hello, everyone!  Here's the newest round of polls!

If you'd like to submit a suggestion for next month's movie list, you can find that **[HERE][lotto]**. Next month's theme is **"IMMATURE COMEDY"**.  November is a month dedicated to avoiding certain things, like shaving.  Or other things.  But we've decided to avoid....avoiding those things.  What I'm trying to say here is, this month is all about enjoying some good obscene teenage comedies.

This submission form will be closed for pre-screening and selection on November 7th, so make sure to vote before then, because you'll be voting on your suggestions very soon after it closes!

As for this weekend, we've got two immature films already lined up!

| Date | First Movie | Second Movie | 1st Pony Episode | 2nd Pony Episode |
| :----------: | :---------------: | :---------------: | :---------------: | :---------------: | 
| Nov 6-7 | [American Pie (1999)][m1] | [Superbad (2007)][m2] | [MLP FiM 5x25 - The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1][p1] | [MLP FiM 5x26 - The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2][p2] |

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  All of the films for next month will be announced in our next news post.  Hope to see you then!
