But wait! There's more!

Trilogy Summer is great and all but sometimes there's not just three
movies in a series but four. Or six! Or twelve! We want to give
them their chance too, since like trilogies they're part of a series
no one wants to see *just* the third movie of or whatever, so we're
having us another event!

For the week of December 7-11, we'll be showing the entirety of the
*Harry Potter* franchise! Two movies back to back, every day at the
usual Friday Night time. Eight movies, four days, with the usual
Friday Movie Night capping off the week.

And the week after that? Well that's a surprise.

Stay tuned to Bronystate!
