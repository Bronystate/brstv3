## Ban Appeals

**Know the difference between a kick and a ban**

When you are kicked, your client will print a message stating you were kicked, with a reason (in parentheses).  
When you are banned, the kick message will say so, and you will be unable to join chat until the ban is lifted.

You must appeal a ban in order for it to be lifted.

**WARNING:** Attempting to evade your ban by any means revokes your right to appeal.

Appeals should be sent to **bronystate@gmail.com** with the subject **Ban Appeal**. You must include:

 - Your nick
 - The reason for your ban
 - Approximate date you were banned
 - Reason why we should unban you

Appeals will be **posted publicly** on the site.  
Bronystate Staff will evaluate your appeal and make a decision whether or not the ban will be lifted.  
You may continue to appeal a ban if your first attempt is rejected.

## Brony Movie Night and the Lottery

*[Eastern Time]: UTC-5, -4 during US Daylight Saving Time

Movie Nights are held every Friday at 7pm Eastern Time and Saturday at 2pm Eastern Time, and consist of two
movies and two episodes of *My Little Pony*, chosen by our users.

Each week, we send out a lottery form you can use to cast your vote. The form consists of your:

 - IRC nickname (so we can tell who won!)
 - One vote for a movie (make it a good one!)
 - A link to find the movie (if it's particularly obscure)
 - One vote for a pony episode (find your favorite!)

Then, alternating each week's Friday and Saturday, we randomly choose from the list of votes what will be shown
on the following week's Movie Night. However, before we do so, the staff looks over the list to disqualify
certain entries, by the following criteria:

 - Movies must wait **six months** before being eligible for Movie Night again
 - Users must wait **four weeks** before they may win another movie or episode, whichever they won previously
 - Movies shown **three times** are entered into the Bronystate Vault, ineligible for airing except on special occasion
 - Movies earning extraordinarily terrible chat reception may be classified **Worst Movie Clause**, ineligible to air ever again
 - Movies that do not meet the community's standards may be disqualified at staff discretion

**NOTE:** In the event your movie is disqualified by staff, we will make an attempt to contact you via IRC for an alternate,
within a reasonable period of time. If you cannot be reached, we will choose another winner, or potentially pick a movie ourselves.
