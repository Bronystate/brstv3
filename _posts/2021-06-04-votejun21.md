Hello, everyone!  Here's the newest round of polls!

If you'd like to submit a suggestion for next month's movie list, you can find that **[HERE][lotto]**. Next month's theme is **"SINGING"**.  When times are tough, or joyful, or any sort of mood, do you find that you just want to break down into song?  We're looking for some films that capture the feeling of singing your emotions out loud to the world.  It doesn't have to be a musical, mind, just a film with singing involved in some way.

This submission form will be closed for pre-screening and selection on June 8th, so make sure to vote before then, because you'll be voting on your suggestions very soon after it closes!

As for this weekend, we've got two films already lined up!

| Date | First Movie | Second Movie | 1st Pony Episode | 2nd Pony Episode |
| :----------: | :---------------: | :---------------: | :---------------: | :---------------: |

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  Hope to see you then!
