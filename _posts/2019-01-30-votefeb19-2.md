Hello, everyone!  We've looked through your suggestions and we're ready for your votes!

Voting for this month's films is **[HERE][lotto]**!  This month's theme is **"LABORS OF LOVE"**!  We're looking for films in which the creators poured their heart and soul into the project, and it shows with the high quality of the final result!  Think as broadly as you like with this one, as there are many movies out there whose creators clearly put forth all of their creative efforts in bringing their pet projects to life!

This poll will be closed on February 2nd, so be sure to vote before then!

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  All of the films for next month will be announced in our next news post.  Hope to see you then!
