Hello, everyone!  We've looked through your suggestions and we're ready for your votes!

Voting for this month's films is **[HERE][lotto]**!  This month's theme is **"HAPPY"**.  We're looking for any film which makes you smile, smile, smile, yes we are!  In times like these, it can sometimes be really helpful to curl up with a good positive movie that helps you get away from things.  So we want to see your ideas for what sort of films make you happy!  And yes, we're aware that's a fairly broad category, so have some fun with it!

This poll will be closed on April 4th, so be sure to vote before then!

As for this week (April 3-4), we have the following planned for you:
-	**[The Lego Movie (2014)][m1]**
-	**[The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part (2019)][m2]**
-	**[MLP FiM 2x19 - Putting Your Hoof Down][p1]**
-	**[MLP FiM 2x20 - It's About Time][p2]**

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  All of the films for next month will be announced in our next news post.  Hope to see you then!
