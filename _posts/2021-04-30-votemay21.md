Hello, everyone!  Here's the newest round of polls!

If you'd like to submit a suggestion for next month's movie list, you can find that **[HERE][lotto]**. Next month's theme is **"SPORTS"**.  With the weather getting better, we want to get out and active!  So we're looking for interesting athletic films that highlight the greatest game of them all....which is to say, whichever game strikes your fancy.  Dig up your favorite film about sports of any kind and send them our way!

This submission form will be closed for pre-screening and selection on May 4th, so make sure to vote before then, because you'll be voting on your suggestions very soon after it closes!

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  Hope to see you then!
