Hello, everyone!  Here's the newest round of polls!

If you'd like to submit a suggestion for next month's movie list, you can find that **[HERE][lotto]**. Next month's theme is **"WORK"**.  After a month of high-thrills heists, we're looking to lay low for a while.  So why don't we spend this month trying to blend in by focusing on the workplace?  Don't feel limited to the cubicle, either!  Anything involving hard-working folks (or perhaps even some who are not so hard-working) is a perfect fit for this month.

This submission form will be closed for pre-screening and selection on June 7th, so make sure to vote before then, because you'll be voting on your suggestions very soon after it closes!

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  All of the films for next month will be announced in our next news post.  Hope to see you then!  And don't forget: Season 9 has finally begun!  We will be airing new episodes live as we usually do, so be sure to tune in for that!
