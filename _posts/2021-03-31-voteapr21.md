Hello, everyone!  Here's the newest round of polls!

If you'd like to submit a suggestion for next month's movie list, you can find that **[HERE][lotto]**. Next month's theme is **"ANIMATION"**.  This theme's simple enough: we're looking for films which feature primarily animation.  They can be of any genre or type, so long as they're animated.

This submission form will be closed for pre-screening and selection on April 5th, so make sure to vote before then, because you'll be voting on your suggestions very soon after it closes!

To help you get an idea of what we're looking for, we've got two films already selected for this week!

| Date | First Movie | Second Movie | 1st Pony Episode | 2nd Pony Episode |
| :----------: | :---------------: | :---------------: | :---------------: | :---------------: | 
| Apr 2-3 | [The Breadwinner (2017)][m1] | [Wolfwalkers (2020)][m2] | [MLP FiM 7x15 - Triple Threat][p1] | [MLP FiM 7x16 - Campfire Tales][p2] |

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  Hope to see you then!
