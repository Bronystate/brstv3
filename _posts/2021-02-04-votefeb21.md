Hello, everyone!  Here's the newest round of polls!

If you'd like to submit a suggestion for next month's movie list, you can find that **[HERE][lotto]**. Next month's theme is **"RAGTAG GROUP"**.  We're putting together a team.  A team composed of misfits, outcasts, losers, or otherwise dreadfully downcast people to send off on a grand adventure!  As they work together in the most dire of circumstances, they might learn more about themselves and grow together.  Or maybe they don't.  Sometimes it's just nice to have some friends to be with.

This submission form will be closed for pre-screening and selection on February 10th, so make sure to vote before then, because you'll be voting on your suggestions very soon after it closes!

To help you get an idea of what we're looking for, we've got two films already selected for this week!

| Date | First Movie | Second Movie | 1st Pony Episode | 2nd Pony Episode |

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  Hope to see you then!
