Hello, everyone!  We've looked through your suggestions and we're ready for your votes!

Voting for this month's films is **[HERE][lotto]**!  This month's theme is **"WORK"**.  After a month of high-thrills heists, we're looking to lay low for a while.  So why don't we spend this month trying to blend in by focusing on the workplace?  Don't feel limited to the cubicle, either!  Anything involving hard-working folks (or perhaps even some who are not so hard-working) is a perfect fit for this month.

This poll will be closed on June 14th, so be sure to vote before then!

As for this week (June 7-8), we have the following planned for you:
-	**[Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994)][m1]**
-	**[Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (2004)][m2]**
-	**[MLP FiM 8x19 - On the Road to Friendship][p1]**
-	**[MLP FiM 8x20 - The Washouts][p2]**

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  All of the films for next month will be announced in our next news post.  Hope to see you then!  And don't forget: Season 9 is starting up on April 6th! We will be airing the episode live as we usually do, so be sure to tune in for that!
