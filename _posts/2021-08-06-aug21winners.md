For the month of August, we've decided to have a month dedicated to the important things in life: family.  And fast cars with endless gearboxes driving furiously.  That's right, it's time for a month of Fast and Furious films!

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday. The films and episodes for this month are....
