# Spaces matter! Line up the - and values, blank lines okay
# "url" field is optional, "title" and "time" are not
# "title" will be lowercased when inserted into header bar
# Remember most recent lottery appears below stream

# TIME FORMAT: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM -TTTT (or +TTTT)
#   YYYY: year
#   MM: month
#   DD: day
#   HH: hour
#   MM: minute
#   TTTT: timezone offset from UTC
#
# Enter times in *your* timezone
#   unless you know the time's EST/EDT time
#   or +0000 for UTC
# For Daylight Savings, input the time it *will* be
# Safest to always specify timezone, will assume UTC without it
#
# NOTE: EXPIRED TIMERS WILL NOT SELF-DELETE
# You'll have to periodically clean out old times
#
# Next pending timer goes into bar under header
# Next "show-in-sidebar" timers go into sidebar
# If all timers are in the past, timerbar hides
#
# TODO: Override a specific timer for timerbar
# TODO: Automatically calculate movie night times
#       so we don't need to enter them here
