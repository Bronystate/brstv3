Hello, everyone!  I have some unfortunate news to share.  Movie Night for April 5th is likely going to be cancelled due to scheduling conflicts.  We really wanted to make this happen for you, especially on the night before a new season premiere.  But all of us here at Bronystate are quite busy these days, and it's sometimes difficult to make things happen when everybody is busy on the same night.

The good news, however, is that we still plan to continue with Saturday's Movie Night, and we have a great pair of films to show off.  And of course, we still plan to air the season premiere tomorrow, as well.  I hope you'll join us then!
