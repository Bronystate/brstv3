Hello, everyone!  We've looked through your suggestions and we're ready for your votes!

Voting for this month's films is **[HERE][lotto]**!  This month's theme is **"MADE FOR TV"**. Since we're all still stuck at home, we're looking for some films that were made with the small screen in mind. Made-for-TV films are very common, and they aren't always the best in terms of production, but there are times when these films can be surprisingly good little gems! At the very least, it's a good way to kill a few hours. So send us your favorite made-for-TV films!

This poll will be closed on August 13th, so be sure to vote before then!

As for this week (August 7-8), we have the following planned for you:
-	**[Duel (1971)][m1]**
-	**[All Quiet on the Western Front (1979)][m2]**
-	**[MLP FiM 4x25 - Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1][p1]**
-	**[MLP FiM 4x26 - Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2][p2]**

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  All of the films for next month will be announced in our next news post.  Hope to see you then!
