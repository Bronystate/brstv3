Hello, everyone!  Here's the newest round of polls!

If you'd like to submit a suggestion for next month's movie list, you can find that **[HERE][lotto]**. Next month's theme is **"SPOOKY SCARY CINEMA"**.  In past Octobers, we've tried not to go for the obvious low-hanging fruit that October tends to be.  But we've danced around it for long enough.  October is the month of Halloween, and is often dominated by horror films.  And now, we're looking for your favorites.  Which movies have sent shivers down your spine?

This submission form will be closed for pre-screening and selection on October 4th, so make sure to vote before then, because you'll be voting on your suggestions very soon after it closes!

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  All of the films for next month will be announced in our next news post.  Hope to see you then!  And don't forget: Season 9 will be ending very soon!  Tune in October 12th for the big finale!
