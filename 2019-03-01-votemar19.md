Hello, everyone!  Here's the newest round of polls!

If you'd like to submit a suggestion for next month's movie list, you can find that **[HERE][lotto]**. Next month's theme is **"LOYAL PETS"**.  This month's theme is "LOYAL PETS"!  Pets are truly some of the best people out there, and we're dedicating this month to them!  Movies in which loyal pets are helping their owners out, or just trying to get back home, will be a welcome choice for this month.  Just remember, they're all good pets, Brent.

This submission form will be closed for pre-screening and selection on March 8th, so make sure to vote before then, because you'll be voting on your suggestions very soon after it closes!  And don't worry about this week's movies!  We have something planned for you, but you'll have to tune in to find out what it is! :)

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  All of the films for next month will be announced in our next news post.  Hope to see you then!
