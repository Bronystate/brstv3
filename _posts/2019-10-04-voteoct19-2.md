Hello, everyone!  We've looked through your suggestions and we're ready for your votes!

Voting for this month's films is **[HERE][lotto]**!  This month's theme is **"SPOOKY SCARY CINEMA"**.  In past Octobers, we've tried not to go for the obvious low-hanging fruit that October tends to be.  But we've danced around it for long enough.  October is the month of Halloween, and is often dominated by horror films.  And now, we're looking for your favorites.  Which movies have sent shivers down your spine?

This poll will be closed on October 11th, so be sure to vote before then!

As for this week (October 4th-5th), we have the following planned for you:
-	**[The Shining (1980)][m1]**
-	**[Vampire's Kiss (1988)][m2]**
-	**[MLP FiM 9x22 - Growing Up is Hard to Do][p1]**
-	**[MLP FiM 9x23 - The Big Mac Question][p2]** (Saturday only)

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  All of the films for next month will be announced in our next news post.  Hope to see you then!  And don't forget: Season 9 is starting up on April 6th! We will be airing the episode live as we usually do, so be sure to tune in for that!
