Hello, everyone!  Here's the newest round of polls!

If you'd like to submit a suggestion for next month's movie list, you can find that **[HERE][lotto]**. Next month's theme is **"ROAD TRIP"**.  Ordinarily this is the month for "spooky" themes, but it's been kind of a spooky year in general, so let's go with something different.  Let's just hop in a car and take a road trip.  We can go across the state, across the country, or around the world for all it matters!

This submission form will be closed for pre-screening and selection on October 5th, so make sure to vote before then, because you'll be voting on your suggestions very soon after it closes!

As for this weekend, we've got two road-raging films already lined up!

| Date | First Movie | Second Movie | 1st Pony Episode | 2nd Pony Episode |
| :----------: | :---------------: | :---------------: | :---------------: | :---------------: | 
| Oct 2-3 | [The Big Bus (1976)][m1] | [Mad Max: Fury Road (2015)][m2] | [MLP FiM 5x15 - Rarity Investigates!][p1] | [MLP FiM 5x16 - Made in Manehattan][p2] |

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  All of the films for next month will be announced in our next news post.  Hope to see you then!
