Hello, everyone!  We've looked through your suggestions and we're ready for your votes!

Voting for this month's films is **[HERE][lotto]**!  This month's theme is **"CRIME"**.  This would include any film involving daring robberies, high-speed chases, or even just a high-tension thriller with a game of cat and mouse between detectives and criminals.  If it does the crime, it'll do the time (on stream).

This poll will be closed on September 8th, so be sure to vote before then!

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  All of the films for next month will be announced in our next news post.  Hope to see you then!
