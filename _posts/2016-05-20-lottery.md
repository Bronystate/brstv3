Holy crap I finally figured out how to make lotto posts on the new website! Since I spent all my brain power just getting to the point where I can write posts again you'll have to wait for an imaginative news post some other time.

This week we're headed to a barbaric age to watch Red Sonja's quest for...something. Whatever it is I'm sure it's a thrilling adventure. Then we travel to an old west populated by desert critters in Rango; the animated love letter to the Western genre.

[Lottery for this weekend is right here][lotto]! Brony Movie Night will begin at 7:00 PM EDT Friday and for Euro-reprise at 2:00 EDT Saturday, and we will draw the lottery winners on Saturday, between movies. Don't forget to stick around after movie night for an encore of the new episode as well!
