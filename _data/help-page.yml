- i: backlog
  q: What movies have been shown at Bronystate?
  a: |
    We maintain a long backlog of every movie we've ever shown, and it can be
    easily found at: <http://bit.ly/bronystatebacklog>

- i: howto-IRC
  q: How can I connect to the chat?
  a: |
    Well you could use the Iris chat client embedded on the front page. Simply
    click on one of the cutie marks to connect to that side channel as well as
    the main **#bronystate** channel. Note that side channels are closed and
    muted outside of live episode streams.
    
    You can also connect your own client to **irc.ponychat.net** if you have one.
    
    If you don't have a client, we recommend [Hexchat][hxc] for its ease of use.

- i: howto-lottery
  q: Where do I go to vote for Movie Night?
  a: |
    Each week we put out a news post with the week's lottery winners, which will
    appear underneath the stream embed on the front page, as well as in our main
    news feeds.
    
    The link to the next lottery is included in that post. Note that only the
    most recent lottery post will have a valid link; don't vote in an expired
    lottery!

- i: issue-reporting
  q: How do I report an issue with the site or make a suggestion?
  a: |
    We maintain a public issue tracker at [our Github repository][gh]. If you
    see a bug somewhere on the site, or have a suggestion, please open an issue,
    and we will get back to you. Please note that you will require a Github
    account in order to open issues.
    
    If you have a suggestion for an improvement to the site, and are comfortable
    with code, try forking the repository and making the changes yourself in a
    new branch, and pull request that branch back to us! We'd love to have your
    input on new features.

- i: nopones
  q: Why aren't there ponies on the stream?
  a: |
    We don't always show *My Little Pony*, because too much of a good thing is,
    well, too much of a good thing. We like to keep things varied at Bronystate,
    and so show programming of all kinds. Today maybe it's gaming, tomorrow an
    old show you didn't realize you missed, the next day maybe everyone's busy
    and there's no stream at all.
    
    The only fixed events we hold are the Friday and Saturday Movie Nights, and
    live new episodes of *My Little Pony* as they air.
    
    Stay tuned to Bronystate, you never know what will come up next!
- i: novideo
  q: Why is chat talking about a stream if it looks offline to me?
  a: |
    We have probably just swapped stream embeds, which can take up to an hour to
    filter through our caching. Try visiting <http://www.bronystate.net/index.html>
    directly, and flush your browser cache. This will bring you the most current
    version of the front page, and you should see the stream again.
- i: adblocking
  q: Why are there ads on the stream?
  a: |
    Use an ad-blocking extension for your browser to prevent stream ads from
    running. We recommend [uBlock Origin][uo] for it's active maintenance, low
    CPU and memory footprint, and effectiveness across all platforms.
    
    Live airings of new *Friendship is Magic* episodes are captured directly
    from a cable connection, so commercials are unavoidable. Bronystate re-airs
    the new episode without commercials following our Saturday Movie Night
    event.

- i: kicked
  q: Why was I kicked?
  a: |
    Your client will show you a message as you are kicked from channel telling
    you why. Be sure to [read the Rules][r] to avoid getting kicked in the first
    place!

- i: appeal
  q: How do I appeal a ban?
  a: |
    See the [Ban Appeals](/rules#ban-appeals) section of the Rules.
