Hello, everyone! We've looked through your suggestions and we're ready for your votes!

Voting for this month's films is **[HERE][lotto]**!  This month's theme is **"IMMATURE COMEDY"**.  November is a month dedicated to avoiding certain things, like shaving.  Or other things.  But we've decided to avoid....avoiding those things.  What I'm trying to say here is, this month is all about enjoying some good obscene teenage comedies.

This poll will be closed on November 16th, so be sure to vote before then!

As for this weekend, we've got two films already lined up!

| Date | First Movie | Second Movie | 1st Pony Episode | 2nd Pony Episode |
| :----------: | :---------------: | :---------------: | :---------------: | :---------------: | 
| Nov 13-14 | [Weird Science (1985)][m1] | [Revenge of the Nerds (1984)][m2] | [MLP FiM 6x01 - The Crystalling - Part 1][p1] | [MLP FiM 6x02 - The Crystalling - Part 2][p2] |

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  All of the films for next month will be announced in our next news post.  Hope to see you then!
