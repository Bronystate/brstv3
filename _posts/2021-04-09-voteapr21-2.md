Hello, everyone! We've looked through your suggestions and we're ready for your votes!

Voting for this month's films is **[HERE][lotto]**!  This month's theme is **"ANIMATION"**.  This theme's simple enough: we're looking for films which feature primarily animation. They can be of any genre or type, so long as they're animated.

This poll will be closed on April 13th, so be sure to vote before then!

As for this weekend, we've got two films already lined up!

| Date | First Movie | Second Movie | 1st Pony Episode | 2nd Pony Episode |

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  All of the films for next month will be announced in our next news post.  Hope to see you then!
