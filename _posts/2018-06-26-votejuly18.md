Hello, everyone!  Here's the newest round of polls!

If you'd like to submit a suggestion for next month's movie list, you can find that **[HERE][lotto]**. Next month's theme is **"VACATION"**.  It's summer time, and that means it's time to think about taking a break from the tedium of work.  We're looking for films focused on travel to exotic locations, meeting new people, and having some fun!  Make sure to pack a sense of adventure!

This submission form will be closed for pre-screening and selection on June 30th, so make sure to vote before then, because you'll be voting on your suggestions next week!  Also, the last set of Mod Picks will be aired on July 6th and 7th.

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  All of the films for next month will be announced in our next news post.  Hope to see you then!
