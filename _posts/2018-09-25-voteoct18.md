Hello, everyone!  Here's the newest round of polls!

If you'd like to submit a suggestion for next month's movie list, you can find that **[HERE][lotto]**. Next month's theme is **"HERESY"**.  Ever been talking with a friend or co-worker and they admit to not having seen a movie that you thought pretty much everyone in the universe had seen?  Those are the films we're looking for.  What films are "must-see" films that you can't go your whole life without watching?

This submission form will be closed for pre-screening and selection on September 29th, so make sure to vote before then, because you'll be voting on your suggestions very soon after it closes!

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  All of the films for next month will be announced in our next news post.  Hope to see you then!
