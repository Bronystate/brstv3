Last week, we had rocks, it was ok...boulder liked it.

Thanks Maud for that uplifting expression, now we just wait for the new episode. It will all begin at 11:30 AM EDT right here on the stream. So come along and see what exciting new adventures our favourite equines will experiance. If you can't catch in the the early sun of the morning, worry not, we will replay the episode at the conclusion of our Euro Movie Night!


[Lottery for this weekend is right here][lotto] and since it only takes 1.10 minutes to complete on avarage according to our statistics so you got no excuse not to tell us what movie you would wish for next week. Brony Movie Night will begin at 7:00 PM EDT Friday and for Euro-reprise at 2:00 EDT Saturday, and we will draw the lottery winners on the Saturday night, between movies.
