    <h1>Bronystate 3.0 is coming</h1>
    <p>A site redesign is long overdue, and we're sick and tired of looking over our shoulders at the pile
      of hacks that was Bronystate 2.0, so we're doing it! We're going to be working hard on getting everything
      running and looking pretty. And by "we" we of course mean Shizu, Saturn, and Phase.
      </p>
    <p>This page might change drastically from the time you're looking now to when it's done, but look forward
      to these fantastic features we have planned!
