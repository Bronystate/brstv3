Hello, everyone!  We've looked through your suggestions and we're ready for your votes!

Voting for this month's films is **[HERE][lotto]**!  This month's theme is **"VACATION"**.  It's summer time, and that means it's time to think about taking a break from the tedium of work.  We're looking for films focused on travel to exotic locations, meeting new people, and having some fun!  Make sure to pack a sense of adventure!

This poll will be closed on July 7th, so make sure to vote before then!

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  All of the films for next month will be announced in our next news post.  Hope to see you then!
