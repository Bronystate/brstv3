# THEATERS HAVE MOVED!

With the launch of Bronystate 3.0, the separate theater pages have been *removed*.

In their place, we now have a [simpler home page](/) containing the stream and 
chat embeds.

**PLEASE UPDATE YOUR BOOKMARKS** to point to [http://www.bronystate.net/](/)

* * * * *

## Hello RANDOM THEATER users!

Click on a cutie mark on the front page to connect to the chat. Note that in
addition to the pony side channel indicated by the cutie mark, you are always
connected to our main channel **#bronystate**, and that the side channels are
closed and muted except during new episode streams.

You can connect your own irc client to **irc.ponychat.net**, and click on the
chat bubble icon under the stream to remove the chat embed and make the stream
player take up the width of the page.
