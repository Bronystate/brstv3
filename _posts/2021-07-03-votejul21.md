Hello, everyone!  Here's the newest round of polls!

If you'd like to submit a suggestion for next month's movie list, you can find that **[HERE][lotto]**. Next month's theme is **"WILDERNESS"**.  We're looking to take a trip into the woods tonight.  Whether it be for camping in the great outdoors, or survival against the harshness of the elements (or anything else, for that matter), we just want to have some fun outside!

This submission form will be closed for pre-screening and selection on June 8th, so make sure to vote before then, because you'll be voting on your suggestions very soon after it closes!

As for this weekend, we've got two films already lined up!

| Date | First Movie | Second Movie | 1st Pony Episode | 2nd Pony Episode |
| :----------: | :---------------: | :---------------: | :---------------: | :---------------: | 
| July 2-3 | [Predator (1987)][m1] | [Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (2017)][m2] | [MLP FiM 8x15 - A Matter of Principals][p1] | [MLP FiM 8x16 - The Hearth's Warming Club][p2] |

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  Hope to see you then!
