We have determined your winners for the month of May!  We've made a bit of a last-minute change in plans with this month's results, because we're looking at bringing back Summer Trilogies starting next month!  So the winners for this month are composed primarily of **non-trilogy** films that got a good number of votes (with the exception of Neverending Story, because honestly it got so many votes and because **nobody** watches it as a trilogy).  More info will arrive for Summer Trilogies some time later this month, so stay tuned!

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  The films and episodes for this month are....
