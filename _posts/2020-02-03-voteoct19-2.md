Hello, everyone!  We've looked through your suggestions and we're ready for your votes!

Voting for this month's films is **[HERE][lotto]**!  This month's theme is **"JAILBREAK"**.  We've been up to no good again, and it's time to fly the coop before the cops arrive! Any films involving an attempt to escape from jail would be included in this month's selection, so come up with your best laid plans and send them to us! And don't worry, we'll make sure you get a cut.

This poll will be closed on February 7th, so be sure to vote before then!

As for this week (February ), we have the following planned for you:
-	**[O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000)][m1]**
-	**[Con Air (1997)][m2]**
-	**[MLP FiM 2x03 - Lesson Zero][p1]**
-	**[MLP FiM 2x04 - Luna Eclipsed][p2]**

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  All of the films for next month will be announced in our next news post.  Hope to see you then!
