First News of the Year :D
We're still chugging along, since everything is now done on the Discord Server, and no new Events regarding MLP are occuring,
no big reason for writing any news has come up.
TitanEmbed, which we've happily used ever since the PonyChat shut down in the beginning of 2019, also now shut down it's services.
After some searching about, we settled on WidgetBot to replace it, while not being as nice as TitanEmbed was, it still does
everything it needs to do in terms of providing a solid Website-Embed for guests who like to just have the chat next to the stream
without directly joining the server first.
