Hello, everyone!  Here's the newest round of polls!

Voting for this month's films is **[HERE][lotto]**!  This month's theme is **"NEW BEGINNINGS"**.  This poll will be closed on December 31st so that we can pick films before New Year's, so make sure to vote before then!

The theme for February's movies is currently undecided, so we do not have a poll for you quite yet.  Sorry!  We will edit this post with the poll for February when we have figured things out!  If you have a good suggestion for February, please feel free to float the idea to any one of our moderating staff.

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  The first two films for next month will be announced on Saturday during intermission.  As for the rest, we'll provide you with little "clues" to try and figure them out.  But don't worry: if you're not into that sort of thing, we'll continue to update the front page with each week's films, so you'll always know which films are coming next.
