Hello, everyone!  Here's the newest round of polls!

If you'd like to submit a suggestion for next month's movie list, you can find that **[HERE][lotto]**. Next month's theme is **"RESISTANCE"**.  We're looking to put up a good fight against The Man, and we're not gonna let him keep us down!  So we're looking for any films which feature a small band of fighters facing off against tyranny, oppression, or maybe just trying to stay alive.  And it doesn't have to be war-related!  Just remember that you can't trust the system.

This submission form will be closed for pre-screening and selection on July 5th, so make sure to vote before then, because you'll be voting on your suggestions very soon after it closes!

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  All of the films for next month will be announced in our next news post.  Hope to see you then!  And don't forget: Season 9 has finally begun!  We will be airing new episodes live as we usually do, so be sure to tune in for that!
