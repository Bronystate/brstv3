Hello, everyone!  Here's the newest round of polls!

If you'd like to submit a suggestion for next month's movie list, you can find that **[HERE][lotto]**. Next month's theme is **"COMEDY GOLD"**.  April is the perfect time for funny business!  You can pick comedy films, or just films with an ample amount of comedy in them.  Whatever gets you giggling is good with us!

This submission form will be closed for pre-screening and selection on April 4th, so make sure to vote before then, because you'll be voting on your suggestions very soon after it closes!

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  All of the films for next month will be announced in our next news post.  Hope to see you then!  And don't forget: Season 9 is starting up on April 6th!  We will be airing the episode live as we usually do, so be sure to tune in for that!
