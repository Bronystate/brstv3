This week we shall be seeing two visions of the future. Both seem to be a bit out of line with what really happened later on. Also, could I offer you a free AOL CD?

All sillyness aside, we will be showing Children of Men, a movie about a future lacking children (at least its going to be quiet) and You've got Mail, a classic romantic comedy famed (as in i remember that it was about) the early days of mass market internet. So that shall be fun!

We will also be showing some pony eps to tide us over until mini hiatus ends, so we shall see Rarity investigate something in Rarity Investigates (obviously) and see how dragons deal with greed in Secret of My Excess!

We will also continue, however, the timeplan is not entirely certain so keep informed by asking me on chat about that. This weeks trilogies be Mad Max and Evil Dead.

[Lottery for this weekend is right here][lotto]! Brony Movie Night will begin at 7:00 PM EDT Friday and for Euro-reprise at 2:00 EDT Friday, and we will draw the lottery winners on Friday, between movies.
