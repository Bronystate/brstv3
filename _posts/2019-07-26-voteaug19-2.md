Hello, everyone!  We've looked through your suggestions and we're ready for your votes!

Voting for this month's films is **[HERE][lotto]**!  This month's theme is **"BACK TO SCHOOL"**.  It's that time of the year again!  We're looking to get ready for the new year, and that means it's time to bring out the school-related films.  Whether it's about attending school or skipping it, student or teacher, we're eager to get the year started right with some fresh new ideas!

This poll will be closed on July 12th, so be sure to vote before then!

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  All of the films for next month will be announced in our next news post.  Hope to see you then!  And don't forget: Season 9 is starting up on April 6th! We will be airing the episode live as we usually do, so be sure to tune in for that!
