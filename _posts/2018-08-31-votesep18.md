Hello, everyone!  Here's the newest round of polls!

If you'd like to submit a suggestion for next month's movie list, you can find that **[HERE][lotto]**. Next month's theme is **"CRIME"**.  This would include any film involving daring robberies, high-speed chases, or even just a high-tension thriller with a game of cat and mouse between detectives and criminals.  If it does the crime, it'll do the time (on stream).

This submission form will be closed for pre-screening and selection on September 3rd, so make sure to vote before then, because you'll be voting on your suggestions very soon after it closes!

Brony Movie Night will be at its usual time: 7:00 EDT on Friday, and 2:00 PM EDT on Saturday.  All of the films for next month will be announced in our next news post.  Hope to see you then!
