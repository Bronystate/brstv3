Settle in with us for the 2006 **Death Note** movie, and **Inside Out**. I can't wait to watch Joy get rid of her enemies with the death note while Fear and Anger try to figure out who's responsible for all the killings.

Your pony episodes for the week are the two part from season 4 premiere, **Princess Twilight Sparkle Parts 1 & 2**. Be sure to also join us Saturday morning at 11:30am EST for an all new episode of ponies.
